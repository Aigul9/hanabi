# Hanabi

Hanabi is a cooperative card game created by French game designer Antoine Bauza published in 2010 by Asmodée Éditions. 

Being locked down in March 2020, we were willing to play the Hanabi game remotely. Thus, we decided to create an online mobile-friendly version of the game since we both have fun coding and playing.

Like us, please buy the [physical version](https://fr.asmodee.com/fr/games/hanabi/products/hanabi/) to support its creator if you like this game!
